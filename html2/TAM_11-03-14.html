The carvers, artist in their own right, were highly skilled specialists. They were knowledgable in the strength and grain of the wood and had great expertise in curing and polishing their work.

These weapons were made for chiefs and high-ranking warriors and were treasured heirlooms. They have traveled far – from Australia, New Zealand, the Polynesian Islands, all the way to the Northwest Coast of British Columbia – and now here in New York City.

Inspired by the route of Captain James Cook on his Pacific Voyages, this exhibit reflects the weapons he and his crew would have encountered and collected during their explorations."></td>
